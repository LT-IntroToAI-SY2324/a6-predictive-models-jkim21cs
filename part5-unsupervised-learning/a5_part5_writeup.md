## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
    Orange: Superfluous - high income + high spending 
    Red: Frugal - high income + low spending
    Blue: Balanced - mid income + mid spending 
    Green: Shopaholic - low income + high spending
    Purple: Poor - low income +  low spending

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
    A customer who has a medium income and low spending habits would most likely be in the balanced spending group.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
    The marketing team might approach the superfluous customer group by advertising their products as luxurious and "class-elevating" as consumers in this group may want to show off their wealth through physical means.
