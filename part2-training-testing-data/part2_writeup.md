# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
    This model is more effective than the model that was created in part 1 because the sample size is much larger, leading to a much smaller margin of error.  

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
    The R squared coeefficient tells you " how much" correlation there is between the variables in the graph. In this case, the R squared coefficients is telling us if there is a correlation between blood pressure and age. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
    I would say that the model is accurate as the predicted and actual values are very similar. According to the American Heart Association as an individual grows older, their systolic blood pressure normally rises due to the increasing stiffness of arteries. For example, the graph predicted that at the age of 17 the blood pressure of that person would be 108.44 while the actual value at that age was 114 which, taking into account typical variances, is pretty accurate.
